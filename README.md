# soMake
A program to easily create script files for SOMA!

## Important Note

This was the first big project I have done on VB.net.

As such, my coding style is horribly unreadable and you'll most likely not benefit from this source code.

I am only releasing the source because nobody likes using closed source programs. Not only can you not change anything you want, but you also have to trust the developer not to put anything malicious into it.

Anyway, I hope you can find use in this source one way or another. Please respect the license and enjoy!

## Issues

Feel free to post any bugs, suggestions or feedback over on the issues page.

I'll be sure to check it commonly and answer to as much as I can!

## Help

I'm not too sure if I'll create a full walkthrough on using this program; most things are pretty self-explanatory.

The basics can be found in the readme included in the binary release.
